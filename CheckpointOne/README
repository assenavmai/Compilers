INTRODUCTION
-------------

This projects is checkpoint 1 of 3 for our fourth year compilers class, CIS*4650. For this checkpoint, we have to create a scanner and parser to the CMinus specification. After building these two components, a syntax tree is built and sent to stdout.


VERSION CONTROL
----------------

We used GitHub for version control.

The program handed in for submission can be found at: http://github.com/assenavmai/Compilers/ in the 'recovery' branch

REQUIREMENTS
-------------

This program requires:

    * lex
    * yacc
    * gcc

BUILD & RUN
------------

    1) type 'make' to compile the program
    2) type ./cm -a [filename].cm to compile a CMinus program and output it's contents into an '.abs' file
    3) The abstract syntax tree can be printed out onto stdout if the STDOUT flag is changed within main.

TESTING
----------

Test files are provided to run the program. These files include:

	* 1.cm: No errors in the file.
	* 2.cm: 
	* 3.cm:
	* 4.cm: Tests random invalid characters within the file,

INTRODUCTION
-------------

This projects is checkpoint 1 of 3 for our fourth year compilers class, CIS*4650. For this checkpoint, we have to create a scanner and parser to the CMinus specification. After building these two components, a syntax tree is built and sent to stdout.


VERSION CONTROL
----------------

We used GitHub for version control.

The program handed in for submission can be found at: http://github.com/assenavmai/Compilers/ in the 'recovery' branch

REQUIREMENTS
-------------

This program requires:

    * lex
    * yacc
    * gcc

The Uthash and Utlist library was used created by Troy D. Hanson for the implementation for the hash table and linked list. There are no extra flags to run this program, utlist.h and uthash.h are all that is needed for this.

You can find the documentation page here: https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/

BUILD & RUN
------------

    1) type 'make' to compile the program

    Options:
    2) type ./cm -a [filename].cm to compile a CMinus program and output it's contents into an '.abs' file
    	The abstract syntax tree can be printed out onto stdout if the STDOUT flag is changed within main.
    3) type ./cm -s [filename].cm to compile a CMinus program and output it's contents into an '.sym' file
    	The symbol table can be printined out to stdout if the STDOUT flag is changed within main.
    4) type ./cm -c [filename].cm to compile a CMinus program and output it's contents into an '.tm' file
    	The contents can then be run within the TM simulator

    	To do this:
    		Run ./tm [filename].tm where the file is the file that was generated. You can then follow the options within the simulator to run the program.


TESTING
----------

Test files are provided to run the program. These files include:

	* 1.cm: No errors in the file.
	* 2.cm: incorrect multiplcation errors and relational errors
	* 3.cm: unknown function type and unknown symbols
	* 4.cm: Tests random invalid characters within the file, 
	* 5.cm: 	
		* incorrect return statement (line 27)
		* incorrect if-else statment (line 15)
		* incorrect call statement (line 36)
		* additonal unknown symbols found in the code (line 16, 22, 32)
		* unknown function type (line 24)
		* incorrect addition operators (line 31)
	* 6.cm:
	* 7.cm:
	* 8.cm:
	* 9.cm:
	* 10.cm:

To test these files simply compile with 'make' and run with ./cm -a [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].cm
A corresponding [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].abs file will be produced.
